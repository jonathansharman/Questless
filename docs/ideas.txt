================================================================================
Spellcasting
================================================================================
Player acquires new spells through various means along the way
    Spells may be discovered by entering a trance - a color-dependent mini-game
        Different type of trance for each color
            White
            Black
            Green
            Red
            Blue
            Yellow
        At the conclusion, power and/or resistance for that color improve, and a new spell may be obtained, if a scroll is available
            Rewards are semi-random
    Spells may be bought or traded for
    Spells may be stolen or looted from corpses, found lying around, etc.
Must be written on magic scrolls or in a grimoire (both reusable) and recited to take effect
    Each scroll or grimoire page may be labeled to describe the effect of the spell
    Scrolls may be inserted into the grimoire as a new page at no cost
    Spell labels may be changed later
    Spell runes may not be changed
    Player may acquire a notebook (possibly given at the start) to write/rewrite freely in
NPCs may use spells, but only if they are not mute (beasts are mute)
    The game will play the sound effect of the spell, allowing the player to copy it if he/she can discern what is said (still doing this?)
Incantation
    Before a spell can be cast, its incantation must be performed
    Takes a significant amount of time, depending on the spell
    Once the incantation is complete, the spell's scroll/page is charged
    Charged spells may be cast very quickly (maybe instantly?)
    Some spells may be incanted multiple times to build up more charges
    Spell charges expire over time (should they?)
    While a spell is charged, it occupies some of the spellcaster's spirit
        The amount of spirit required per charge is a property of each spell
        This limits the number of spells that can be quickly cast during a single battle
    Mana cost is not incurred until the spell is actually cast
When casting a spell, the caster may choose the magnitude and duration of the spell, if applicable. The cost of the casting is linear with the duration and quasilinear (n log n) with the magnitude.

================================================================================

================================================================================
Vitality
    Determines maximum health
Spirit

Strength
    Affects attack power, carry capacity
Endurance
    Determines defense power
Stamina
    Determines maximum energy
Agility
    Determines movement speed
Dexterity

Stealth
    Makes it more difficult to be sensed by other beings
        Attacking from stealth does more damage, in proportion to the degree of stealth (e.g., attacking a sleeping opponent does enormous damage; attacking from the shadows does somewhat less damage)
    Makes it more difficult for other beings to discern stats, abilities, and actions (counters intellect)
Vision
    Improves ability to attributes of other beings and to identify carried items
    Reduces enemy stealth
    Enables wider field of view
Light Affinity
    Determines preferred light level. Visual range is maximal when ambient light level matches light affinity.
        Effective vision at a given point is vision - abs(light level - light affinity) * factor / distance
Hearing
    Reduces enemy stealth
Intellect
    Improves ability to discern stats, abilities, and actions of opponents, nature of new items
Minimum Temperature

================================================================================
Conditions
================================================================================
Health
    Regenerates slowly over time, faster while asleep
Mana
    Regenerates over time, faster while asleep
Weariness
    The result of performing actions
        Each attack with a weapon costs weariness in proportion to its weight ??
    Reduces strength, endurance
    Reduced by sleeping or idling
Hunger
    Occurs over time and also as a result of performing actions
    Accrues more slowly while asleep
    Reduces regeneration
Sleepiness
    Increases over time
    Reduces agility, intellect

================================================================================

================================================================================
World Mechanics
================================================================================
Travel from one tile to the next requires a certain number of turns
    Dependent on factors like agility and tile material
Flying beings can traverse tiles that others cannot
Agent perception and knowledge about the world TODO

================================================================================
Combat Mechanics
================================================================================
Has elements of both real-time and turn-based combat
    Everything that occurs has duration, but the next action may be chosen at one's own pace (sort of similar to FTL)
Every action has a wind-up time and follow-through time
    Wind-up - Time until the action completes
    Follow-through - Time until a new action may be started
Once started, an action cannot be canceled by the being that started it
Damage
    Types
        Slash
        Bludgeon
        Pierce
        Burn
        Freeze
        Blight
    Base damage - Amount of damage per hit intrinsic to a weapon or spell
    Applied damage - Amount of damage the target actually receives after applying strength, buffs, endurance, armor, etc.
    Order of calculation: base damage -> attacker strength, attacker weariness -> armor -> defender endurance, defender weariness
    Formula:
        applied_damage = (base_damage * attacker_strength / (1 + attacker_weariness / attacker_endurance) - armor) / (defender_endurance / (1 + defender_weariness))
Armor
    Armor reduces effective damage by a constant amount per hit, not to exceed the effective damage
    Types
        Pad
            100% to bludgeon
            50% to slash
            25% to pierce
        Deflect
            100% to slash
            50% to pierce
            25% to bludgeon
        Insulate
            100% to burn
            100% to freeze
        Cleanse
            100% to blight
Weapon attributes
    Base damage - The base amount of damage per hit
    Damage rate - Quotient of base damage and sum of ready and recovery times
    Wind-up - Time after attack is initiated before attack completes
    Follow-through - Time after attack connects before another action can be performed
    Cooldown - Time after attack connects before the weapon can be used again
    Equip time
    Unequip time
Relevant item attributes
    Durability - Determines how quickly the item wears out
        When integrity reaches zero, the weapon or armor breaks
        Each use of a weapon decreases its integrity in proportion to its base damage and wear ratio
            wear_per_hit = total(base_damage) * wear_ratio
        Each hit absorbed by armor decreases its integrity in proportion to effective damage reduced and its wear ratio
            wear_per_hit = effective_damage_reduction * wear_ratio
        A weapon does less damage (down to 50%) the lower its integrity
            damage = base_damage * (1 + integrity / durability) / 2
        Armor protects against less damage the lower the integrity
            protection = base_protection * (1 + integrity / durability) / 2
    Weight
        Affects strength requirements of weapons and armor
    Size - tiny, small, medium, large, titanic
Melee attacks require being adjacent to the target, i.e. one tile away, on the turn the attack connects
	Relax this for polearms?

================================================================================
Enemy Ideas
================================================================================
Desert/sand monster - Kicks up sand to blind enemies
Super fast regenerating thing - Require suppressing the regeneration (via debuffs or damage over time) or lots of burst damage to kill

================================================================================
Enchanting
================================================================================
Enhances the qualities of equipment and other items
Requires souls? Blood?
    Obtained from slain enemies and stored, somehow
        Bottles? Gems? Crystals?
    This sounds kind of evil. Maybe enchantment should be more morally neutral.
Uses red magic
Weapon Enchantments
    Lifesteal - Restores health to the attacker in proportion to damage dealt
Armor Enchantments
    ??? - Temporarily increases agility whenever the wearer takes damage

			Does this belong in yellow?
        Transmute??
    Energy Runes
        Charge - Gain mana over time. Total mana restored is equal to casting cost plus spell duration times a constant factor.
            E.g., spend 100 mana to recover 100 mana over 0 turns. Or spend 100 mana to recover 200 mana over, say, 25 turns.
        Overcharge - Gain mana and then lose twice that much over time. The more mana gained, the faster it depletes.
            E.g., gain 0 mana and lose 0 over 0 turns. Gain 100 mana and lose 200 mana over 10 turns. Gain 200 mana and lose 400 mana over 5 turns.
			ALTERNATE IDEA: Gain mana immediately, but also gain mana poisoning in proportion to the amount gained. Mana poisoning deals blight damage over time.
        Discharge - Deal burn damage within an area of effect. Does less damage farther from the caster, down to zero damage at maximum range. Does more damage the fuller the caster's mana is before casting, up to 100% extra damage at full mana.
        Lightning bolt - Deal burn damage to a target being. Lightning bolt will chain to nearby beings, with less range and damage for each jump. Targets are chosen first by proximity, then by lowest yellow resistance, then at random. May target the caster and other friendly beings.
        Scroll Magnet - Steal a scroll from target being.
        Levitate - Temporarily gain the power of flight.
        Summon shock elemental?

        Banish - Banish target being to the chaos for a certain duration. While banished, an impassable and indestructible chaos portal appears in its place. During banishment, the being cannot be interacted with and does not update its state.
		Open portal - ???
        Summon radicals from the chaos

NEED TO DECIDE WHETHER I WANT TO GO GENERIC OR COME UP WITH ALL-NEW BEINGS
	I think I'll do a mix, with most generic beings having different names and some twists on the usual formulas
Should find a compendium of mythical creatures for this
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_legendary_creatures_by_type is a good candidate
Humanoid
    Human
    Goblinoid
        Goblin
            The goblins are a diminutive and simpleminded humanoid race, known particularly for their bad tempers and love of mischief. Goblins rarely form large communities, preferring small family groups or solitude. They are remarkably sneaky, and many an unwary traveler through goblin territory has lost a coin or a limb to a goblin ambush.
