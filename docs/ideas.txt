Spellcasting
================================================================================
Player acquires new spells through various means along the way
	Spells may be discovered by entering a trance - a color-dependent mini-game
		Different type of trance for each color
		At the conclusion, a new spell may be obtained, if a scroll is available
	Spells may be bought or traded for
	Spells may be stolen or looted from corpses, found lying around, etc.
Must be written on magic scrolls or in a grimoire (both reusable) and recited to take effect
	Each scroll or grimoire page may be labeled to describe the effect of the spell
	Scrolls may be inserted into the grimoire as a new page at no cost
	Spell labels may be changed later
	Spell runes may not be changed
	Player may acquire a notebook (possibly given at the start) to write/rewrite freely in
NPCs may use spells, but only if they are not mute (beasts are mute)
	The game will play the sound effect of the spell, allowing the player to copy it if he/she can discern what is said (still doing this?)
When casting a spell, the caster may choose the magnitude and duration of the spell, if applicable. The cost of the casting is typically linear with the duration and quasilinear (n log n) with the magnitude.

================================================================================

Vision
	Improves ability to attributes of other beings and to identify carried items
	Reduces enemy stealth
	Enables wider field of view

Weariness

================================================================================
World Mechanics
================================================================================
Travel from one tile to the next requires a certain number of turns
	Dependent on factors like agility and tile material
Flying beings can traverse tiles that others cannot

================================================================================
Combat Mechanics
================================================================================
Has elements of both real-time and turn-based combat
	Everything that occurs has duration, but the next action may be chosen at one's own pace (sort of similar to FTL)
Every action has a wind-up time and follow-through time
	Wind-up - Time until the action completes
	Follow-through - Time until a new action may be started
Once started, an action cannot be canceled by the being that started it
Damage
	Types
		Slash
		Bludgeon
		Pierce
		Burn
		Freeze
		Blight
	Can be dealt to a body part or to the being directly.
		Damage dealt to a body part is also dealt to the being itself. I.e., part damage is strictly better than being damage.
	Passive shields apply unconditionally to all damage.
		Applied newest to oldest, so that temporary shields will soak more damage than permanent ones.
	Body part armor applies to all damage targeting its part.
	Resistance and vulnerability apply a multiplier to damage
		Damage with multipliers = original damage * (1 + max(0, total vulnerability - total resistance) / 100)
	Resistance and vulnerability are applied after all protection
	The damage algorithm for part damage is roughly as follows:
		1) Shields take wear, reduce damage, and contribute to total resistance.
		2) Shields take resistance wear proportional to maximum possible reduction to current damage.
		3) The part's armor takes wear, reduces damage, and contributes to total resistance.
		4) Damage is reduced by the part's and the being's protection attributes.
		5) Repeat step 2 for the part's armor.
		6) Damage is modified according to total resistance and vulnerability, from all sources.
		7) Part and being lose health based on total damage and the being's endurance.
Protection
	Protection reduces effective damage by a constant amount per hit
	No damage component can deceed 0
	Types
		Pad
			100% to bludgeon
			50% to slash
			25% to pierce
		Deflect
			100% to slash
			50% to pierce
			25% to bludgeon
		Fireproof
			100% to burn
		Frostproof
			100% to freeze
		Cleanse
			100% to blight
Weapon attributes
	Base damage - The base amount of damage per hit
	Damage rate - Quotient of base damage and sum of ready and recovery times
	Wind-up - Time after attack is initiated before attack completes
	Follow-through - Time after attack connects before another action can be performed
	Cooldown - Time after attack connects before the weapon can be used again
	Equip time
	Unequip time
Relevant item attributes
	Durability - Determines how quickly the item wears out
		When integrity reaches zero, the weapon or armor breaks
		Each use of a weapon decreases its integrity in proportion to its base damage and wear ratio
			wear_per_hit = total(base_damage) * wear_ratio
		Each hit absorbed by armor decreases its integrity in proportion to effective damage reduced and its wear ratio
			wear_per_hit = effective_damage_reduction * wear_ratio
		A weapon does less damage (down to 50%) the lower its integrity
			damage = base_damage * (1 + integrity / durability) / 2
		Armor protects against less damage the lower the integrity
			protection = base_protection * (1 + integrity / durability) / 2
	Weight
		Affects strength requirements of weapons and armor
	Size - tiny, small, medium, large, titanic
Melee attacks require being adjacent to the target, i.e. one tile away, on the turn the attack connects
	Relax this for polearms?

================================================================================
Enemy Ideas
================================================================================
Desert/sand monster - Kicks up sand to blind enemies
Super fast regenerating thing - Require suppressing the regeneration (via debuffs or damage over time) or lots of burst damage to kill

================================================================================
Enchanting
================================================================================
Enhances the qualities of equipment and other items
Requires souls? Blood?
	Obtained from slain enemies and stored, somehow
		Bottles? Gems? Crystals?
	This sounds kind of evil. Maybe enchantment should be more morally neutral.
Uses orange magic
Weapon Enchantments
	Lifesteal - Restores health to the attacker in proportion to damage dealt
Armor Enchantments
	??? - Temporarily increases agility whenever the wearer takes damage

================================================================================
Items
================================================================================
Utility
	Pack
		A simple pack for storing some volume of items
		Starting item
	Chaos satchel
		Stores some volume of items in Chaos
		Has a fixed (small) mass and volume, regardless of its contents
		There's a small chance item placed in the satchel will change into random new items, thanks to the shifters
			The chance of mutation for each item is based on the amount of time it has spent in the satchel
				This makes chaos satchels a great place to store junk and a bad place to store valuables
			Smaller mutation chance for higher "quality" satchel
	Stasis chest
		Stores some volume of items in Stasis
		Has a fixed (small) mass and volume, regardless of its contents
		Items in the chest do not experience the passage of time
			This makes stasis chests ideal for storage of perishables
		Inventory is tied to the coordinates of the chest

		Just an object with extremely high specific heat
		Can be used to stay warm in cold weather or cool in hot weather
		This could be a crafting material for clothing

Beings
================================================================================
NEED TO DECIDE WHETHER I WANT TO GO GENERIC OR COME UP WITH ALL-NEW BEINGS
	I think I'll do a mix, with most generic beings having different names and some twists on the usual formulas
Should find a compendium of mythical creatures for this
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_legendary_creatures_by_type is a good candidate
Humanoid
	Human
	Goblinoid
		Goblin
			The goblins are a diminutive and simpleminded humanoid race, known particularly for their bad tempers and love of mischief.

		Orc
		Troll
		Ogre
		Bugbear
Natural
	Beasts
		Wolf
