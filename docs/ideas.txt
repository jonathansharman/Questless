World Mechanics
================================================================================
Travel from one tile to the next requires a certain number of turns
	Dependent on factors like agility and tile material
Flying beings can traverse tiles that others cannot

================================================================================
Enemy Ideas
================================================================================
Desert/sand monster - Kicks up sand to blind enemies
Super fast regenerating thing - Require suppressing the regeneration (via debuffs or damage over time) or lots of burst damage to kill

================================================================================
Enchanting
================================================================================
Enhances the qualities of equipment and other items
Requires souls? Blood?
	Obtained from slain enemies and stored, somehow
		Bottles? Gems? Crystals?
	This sounds kind of evil. Maybe enchantment should be more morally neutral.
Uses orange magic
Weapon Enchantments
	Lifesteal - Restores health to the attacker in proportion to damage dealt
Armor Enchantments
	??? - Temporarily increases agility whenever the wearer takes damage

================================================================================
Items
================================================================================
Utility
	Pack
		A simple pack for storing some volume of items
		Starting item
	Chaos satchel
		Stores some volume of items in Chaos
		Has a fixed (small) mass and volume, regardless of its contents
		There's a small chance item placed in the satchel will change into random new items, thanks to the shifters
			The chance of mutation for each item is based on the amount of time it has spent in the satchel
				This makes chaos satchels a great place to store junk and a bad place to store valuables
			Smaller mutation chance for higher "quality" satchel
		Retrieving items from the choas satchel takes a long time
			This prevents being able to rapidly swap out equipment during a fight
	Stasis chest
		Stores some volume of items in Stasis
		Has a fixed (small) mass and volume, regardless of its contents
		Items in the chest do not experience the passage of time
			This makes stasis chests ideal for storage of perishables
		Inventory is tied to the coordinates of the chest, so the chest can't be moved while retaining its items
	Heat sink
		Just an object with magically high specific heat
		Can be used to stay warm in cold weather or cool in hot weather
		This could be a crafting material for clothing

Enchanting a time amulet is also difficult/expensive and creates a restore point. Using an enchanted time amulet restores the entire world to its state immediately after the amulet was enchanted. A time amulet can be re-enchanted to overwrite its previous restore point. If the player's character dies while carrying at least one enchanted time amulet, the game will present the option to restore the game from one of the available amulets.

		Imprison - For a certain duration, prevent a being from moving.

Beings
================================================================================
NEED TO DECIDE WHETHER I WANT TO GO GENERIC OR COME UP WITH ALL-NEW BEINGS
	I think I'll do a mix, with most generic beings having different names and some twists on the usual formulas
Should find a compendium of mythical creatures for this
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_legendary_creatures_by_type is a good candidate
Humanoid
	Human
	Goblinoid
		Goblin
			The goblins are a diminutive and simpleminded humanoid race, known particularly for their bad tempers and love of mischief. Goblins rarely form large communities, preferring small family groups or solitude. They are remarkably sneaky, and many an unwary traveler through goblin territory has lost a coin or a limb to a goblin ambush.
		Orc
		Troll
		Ogre
		Bugbear
Natural
	Beasts
		Wolf
		Lion
		Bear
		Shark
		Pileous sable slug
			A large slug with beautiful flowing black hair. Poisonous to eat. Its hair is a brewing ingredient.
	Plants
		Man-eating tree
			Has many tentacle-like branches and a glowing eye in the center.
			Abilities:
				1) Snatch - pulls a nearby being one space closer
				2) Strangle - immobilizes and deals damage over time to a being in melee range
				3) Scavenge
		Wobble fern - neutral
			When ingested, causes nausea and instability.
Mythic
	Dragon
	Wyvern
	Chimera
		Creature whose body is a mixture of the parts from two other natural creatures
	Herbivorous predator (need to name it) - neutral
		Has a mutualistic relationship with a certain moss species
		The moss grows from the creature's underside
		The creature eats the moss
		The creature hunts prey to feed to the moss
		The creature spends a lot of time lounging belly-up in the sunlight, allowing the meat it feeds the moss to decompose and the moss to photosynthesize
		The creature can't eat meat, only the moss
	Scrap Vulture - neutral
		Metallic bird creature.
		Eats metal, including weapons and armor (consumes some of the items' integrity).
	Gargoyle - chaotic good
		A living statue with the ability to repel evil and spew water
	Guardian - lawful neutral
Host
	The heavenly host are immortal and thus cannot be slain; however, they can be defeated in battle and incapacitated temporarily. They return to heaven immediately when defeated outside heaven.
	Idea for the function of angels' immortality (also affects appearance)
		Angels are actually just halos that float above the bodies that they control. The bodies are destructible, but the halos themselves are indestructible. After "recharging" a halo will regenerate an attached body.
	Seraph (seraphim) - lawful good
		Worshipers
		Magic: white
		Appearance: humanoid with six wings, two covering the face, two covering the genitals, and two for flight
	Cherub (cherubim) - lawful good
		Guardians and attendants
		Magic: white
		Appearance: "Cherubim have four faces: one of each a man, an ox, a lion, and an eagle. They have four conjoined wings covered with eyes, a lion's body figure, and they have ox's feet." - Wikipedia
	Ophan (ophanim) - lawful good
		Represent God's justice and authority
		Magic: blue
		Appearance: a beryl-colored wheel within a wheel, with one hundred eyes covering the rims
	Hashmal (hashmallim) - lawful good
		Rule over lower angels
		Magic: blue
		Appearance: winged humanoid, wielding a sword or scepter with an orb of light on the head or pommel
	Dynamis (dynameis) - lawful good
		Supervise the movement of the heavenly bodies
		Magic: green
		Appearance: winged humanoid
	Exousia (exousiai)
		Warriors
		Bearer of conscience
		Keeper of history
		Oversee the distribution of power among humankind
		Magic: red
		Appearance: winged humanoid
	Arche (archai)
		Educators, guardians, and inspirers of humankind
		Magic: blue
		Appearance: winged humanoid with crown and scepter
	Archangel
		High-ranking messenger
		Magic: white
		Appearance: winged humanoid
	Malak (pl. malakim)
		Messenger
		Magic: white
		Appearance: winged humanoid
Fiend (Legion)
	Like the heavenly host, many fiends are immortal and can only be incapacitated temporarily. They return to the Abyss immediately when defeated outside it.
	I'm not sure what the fiendish version of a halo should be, if anything. What could give demons their immortality?
	Demonic
		Demon - chaotic evil
		Imp - neutral evil
		Ghoul - neutral evil
			Eats corpses
	Hellhound - neutral evil
	Undead
		Zombie - neutral evil
			Has lowered stats, especially intellect, and is mute

				This should just be a feature of decayed parts, probably
		Lich
			Like a zombie, but with spirit intact; can cast spells
		Wight
			Maintains existence by draining the health and mana of other beings
		Wraith
			The evil spirit of a deceased mortal
Elemental

	Shock
		A chaotic elemental that behaves unpredictably
	Water
		A lawful and retributive elemental that attacks aggressors and protects the weak
		Three phases: frost, water, and steam
			Different types are found in different climates
			Can be forced to change phase with fire/ice attacks
Constructs
	Golem - beings constructed, not summoned, by a mage to do that mage's bidding
		Types
			Mud - Summoned from a dirt tile.
			Wood - Summoned from a tree.
			Stone - Summoned from a stone tile.
			Iron - Summoned from a dirt or stone tile.
